<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Chetan, a passionate web developer and a sophomore at GITAM University. 
🌟 Here's a glimpse into my journey:
</p>

<p>
  I've always been fascinated by the digital world—the way websites come alive,<br /> 
  the magic of interactive interfaces, and the endless possibilities of code.<br /> 
  As a kid, I tinkered with HTML and CSS, creating my first “html-portfolio” webpage.<br /> 
  Little did I know that this curiosity would evolve into a full-blown passion.
</p>

<p>
  Here's what keeps me excited:<br />
<b>Front-End Magic:</b> I love crafting beautiful user interfaces. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my tools of choice. Whether it's responsive designs or seamless animations, I'm all in.<br />
<b>Back-End Adventures:</b> PHP, Python, and Node.js—I'm exploring the back-end realm. Building APIs, handling databases, and ensuring smooth functionality—it's like solving intricate puzzles.<br />
<b>Frameworks and Libraries:</b> React, Vue, and Express—these frameworks empower me. They streamline development, enhance performance, and make my life easier.<br />
<b>Version Control:</b> Git is my trusty sidekick. Branching, merging, and collaborating—it's like a dance where code meets collaboration
